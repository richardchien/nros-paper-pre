# Background

- Increasing CPU core count
- Non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
- Elaborate concurrent data structures
    - fine-grained locking
    - read-copy-update (RCU)
    - Good performance but increased complexity

# Background

- Big kernel lock works for microkernel[^1]
    - does not target NUMA
- Multikernel: per-core kernels, communicating via message passing[^2]
    - scales well
    - too much complexity and overhead for hosts with shared mem

# Overview

- NRkernel
    - node replication[^1]
    - kernel state replica per NUMA node
    - read local replica concurrently
    - mutate by shared operation log, serially
